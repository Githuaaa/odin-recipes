# odin-recipes
I am currently working on a simple recipe website. The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate what skills I've gained so far once I'm done and also it will act as a self-reflection by the end which is a good way to review what I've learnt. 
Throughout this project, I will be demonstrating proficiency in Command-line Basics, Git basics, HTML's elements and tags, Lists, Links and images, commits and working with text. Additionally, I will showcase my ability to conduct user research and incorporate feedback to iterate on the simple website's features and functionality.
This project holds significant relevance in enhancing my technical skills in web development.
